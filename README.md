I'll help you create a high-level plan for upgrading your Airflow deployment from 2.10.4 to 2.11 on AWS while addressing CVEs.

## High-Level Airflow Upgrade Plan

### 1. Pre-Upgrade Assessment
- Review Airflow 2.11 release notes and breaking changes
- Audit current DAGs for deprecated features or API changes
- Identify all custom operators, hooks, and plugins that need testing
- Document current infrastructure configuration (instance types, scaling settings, connections, variables)
- Create inventory of Python dependencies and their versions

### 2. Image Preparation
- Create new Dockerfile based on Airflow 2.11
- Update base image to use latest stable Python version compatible with Airflow 2.11
- Upgrade all Python libraries to patch CVEs (use `pip-audit` or `safety` to scan)
- Update system packages in the base OS layer
- Rebuild provider packages to latest compatible versions
- Implement multi-stage build to minimize image size and attack surface

### 3. Development/Testing Environment
- Deploy upgraded Airflow 2.11 in a separate dev/test environment
- Run security scans on new image (Trivy, Snyk, or AWS ECR scanning)
- Test all critical DAGs end-to-end
- Validate connections to external systems (databases, S3, APIs)
- Performance test with representative workload
- Verify monitoring and logging still function correctly

### 4. Backup and Rollback Preparation
- Back up Airflow metadata database
- Document current configuration (terraform/CloudFormation if applicable)
- Export all connections, variables, and pools
- Tag current production image as rollback version
- Create rollback runbook with specific steps and timings

### 5. Production Upgrade
- Schedule maintenance window with stakeholders
- Pause all DAG schedules
- Wait for running tasks to complete (or set appropriate timeout)
- Deploy new Airflow 2.11 image
- Run database migrations (`airflow db migrate`)
- Restore connections/variables if needed
- Gradually unpause DAGs and monitor

### 6. Post-Upgrade Validation
- Monitor system metrics (CPU, memory, database connections)
- Verify scheduler and worker health
- Check DAG parsing times and task execution
- Review logs for errors or warnings
- Validate data pipeline outputs match expected results
- Run security scan on deployed environment

### 7. Documentation and Cleanup
- Update runbooks and documentation
- Document any configuration changes made
- Remove old images after successful stability period (e.g., 2 weeks)
- Share lessons learned with team

**Key Considerations:**
- If using AWS MWAA (Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow), upgrade process is different - it's managed by AWS
- If self-hosted on ECS/EKS, coordinate with your orchestration platform's deployment strategy
- Plan for extended testing period - Airflow upgrades can surface subtle issues
- Consider blue-green deployment if downtime must be minimized

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific section, or do you need details about your particular AWS deployment setup (MWAA vs self-hosted)?
